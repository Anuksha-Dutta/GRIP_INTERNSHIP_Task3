# GRIP_task3
# AUTHOR: ANUKSHA DUTTA 
This is the 3rd task of my GRIP internship.

As a part of the internship at The Sparks Foundation in the GRIP program, I was tasked to perform EDA on a sample dataset provided. The following was my approach for it. 

EDA or exploratory data analysis is a very important step when working with data. This step helps one get familiar with the dataset before performing any analysis or predictions on it. I took the following steps for the process of EDA:
1. Import the data
2. Clean the data
3. Analyse the data
4. Create a Dashboard
5. Draw the conclusion
